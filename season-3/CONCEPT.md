# Season-3

The HT-Team is thinking about creating something new and different
for the members. Something that changes up Halite but not too much,
and that requires the player to make interesting changes to their
bots.

### Ideas

Here are some ideas that we have for next season :

- 2v2 Matches, as a team.
- Shorter docking time
- Faster regeneration
- Larger explosion
- Faster ships
- Reduced attack
- Bigger maps
- More planets

This should create a tournament where team work between the two bots
is important, and where the bots will have to concentrate more on the
swarm. Finding a good balance between the amount of mining and attacking
the enemy will be one of the key points for victory.
