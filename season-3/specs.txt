**Halite Tournaments Season III is here!**

This is going to be a very special season since the **format** of
the tournament has changed!

- This will be a **2v2** tournament, the teams will be
  **randomly chosen every round**, meaning that once
  a team wins the two players in that team will
  pass the round and be part of a different team
  the next round.

- The format will be **double elimination**, meaning that
  there will be two players coming from the losers
  brackets.

- **The finals**, however, will be **4FFA** so prepare
  yourself to both 2v2 and 4FFA!

The **constants** have also changed, here is a brief explanation
of them :

- Starting Ship Count : 5
- More Planets
- 4000ms timeout per turn
- Faster ships
- Ship regeneration
- Lower weapon damage
- Bigger explosion radius
- Bigger docking radius
- Faster production

Due to the changes with the 2v2 mode, you will have to know the id
of your team mate. This will be pretty easy for you to implement
because : **Player #0 is always with Player#2 and
Player#1 is always with Player#3**, so you will have to write
something like this : https://goo.gl/FkzzGN

Good luck, and remember that the tournament starts on **June 30th!**

May the best bot win!
